Collab with deepseek to make a webbased tool to make never ending descriptive text. Made an initial trial on my website with text snippets written into the code. Asked deepseek for a solution for pulling the text from Project Gutenberg using the Standardized Project Gutenberg Corpus and codespaces. So this is the repository that will attempt that feat, using python.
